# Password Decryption Program

This simple Python script provides a basic program for decoding base64-encoded strings. The script prompts a user to enter a base64-encoded string. It then decodes this string back to its original plaintext form. Please note that base64 is an encoding method. It is not an encryption method. Please note that the encoded data is not secure and can be easily decoded.
