# Password Decoder Program

This simple Python script provides a basic program for decoding base64-encoded strings. The script prompts a user to enter a base64-encoded string. It then decodes this string back to its original plaintext form. Please note that base64 is an encoding method. It is not an encryption method. Please note that the encoded data is not secure and can be easily decoded.

Please note: If you're receiving errors when trying to decode a base64 string that includes the b prefix, it's likely because the b prefix is being treated as part of the actual string to decode, which it should not be.
